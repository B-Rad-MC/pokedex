<H1>Golang Pokedex</H1>

<H2>Description</H2>
A command line tool for exploring the pokemon world and researching the pokemon found within it. Utilizes pokeapi to collect relevant info and lays it out in a way you can interact with.

<H2>Motivation</H2>
My first on-file Go project, and practice implementing API and Json integration

<H2>Quick Start</H2>
Build the go project in your chosen directory and run the created file

<H2>Usage</H2>
This is a command line tool. While the "Pokedex > " prompt is on screen, type your commands and press enter to confirm. The first word is the command, while the second word onwards are the parameters. Use the command "help" to see a list of commands.
